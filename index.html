            <p>The Moon landing of 1969 was a defining moment in history. On July 20th, 1969, NASA's Apollo 11 mission successfully landed astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the lunar surface, marking the first time humans had ever set foot on another celestial body.</p>
            <p>Neil Armstrong's famous words, "That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind," were broadcast to millions of people around the world, forever changing the course of history.</p>

            <h2 id="mission-heading">Apollo 11 Mission</h2>
            <p>The Apollo 11 mission was launched by NASA with the goal of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to Earth. It consisted of three astronauts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Neil Armstrong</strong> – Commander</li>
                <li><strong>Buzz Aldrin</strong> – Lunar Module Pilot</li>
                <li><strong>Michael Collins</strong> – Command Module Pilot</li>
            </ul>
            <p>After a journey of about 240,000 miles, the Lunar Module, named "Eagle," separated from the Command Module and descended to the lunar surface. Armstrong and Aldrin spent over two hours walking on the Moon's surface, collecting samples, and setting up experiments.</p>
